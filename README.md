# 3D_FDTD_Codes_Electromagnetic_Wave
This is a standard FDTD codes for solving 3D full-wave Maxwell's Equations, using cubes as the volume element.
The project actually completed way back in 2003 and a bit out-dated with todays more advanced implementation.
The codes are made open source with GPL 3.0 license and largely forgotten.   
For the theory behind the codes and full implementation with a graphical user interface, please see:
